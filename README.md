(1)Git thinks of its data more like a series of
snapshots of a miniature filesystem. With Git, every time you commit, or save the state of your
project, Git basically takes a picture of what all your files look like at that moment and stores a
reference to that snapshot. To be efficient, if files have not changed, Git doesn¡¯t store the file again,
just a link to the previous identical file it has already stored. Git thinks about its data more like a
stream of snapshots
